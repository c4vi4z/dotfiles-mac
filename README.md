Hiya, these are my personal dotfiles for macOS 26.

**Please keep these things in mind before cloning the repository:**

All folders should be placed in the .config directory (you can view hidden files with Shift + Cmd + .)
The .zshrc file belongs in your $HOME directory.
sillyman.zsh-theme should go in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes.
This is my first repository, so feel free to open an issue or leave a question if you have any tips or suggestions.
Some configuration files are still default and will be updated in the future.
I vibe coded everything here, so please don’t be surprised if something doesn’t work perfectly.

**Setup Instructions**

First, install Xcode Command Line Tools:

xcode-select --install


Next, install Homebrew (if you haven’t already):

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


After that, clone this repository and replace your existing dotfiles with mine.

**Configured Packages**

Oh My Zsh

JankyBorders
