Hiya, these are my dotfiles for macOS 26.

Please keep these things in mind before cloning the repository:
- all folders need to be in the .config directory (see hidden files with Shift+Cmd+.)
- .zshrc is in the $USER directory
- sillyman.zsh-theme is in $USER/.oh-my-zsh/themes
- this is my first repository! please leave an issue/question for some tips :)
- some config files are not changed, will change them in the future
- **I VIBE CODED THE SHIT OUT OF EVERYTHING HERE, PLEASE DONT COMPLAIN WHEN NOTHING WORKS**
  
Install the following packages, and change the dotfiles with mine:

First of all, enable XCode Command Line Tools with xcode-select --install
Second of all, if you haven't already, install Homebrew with this command:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Let it do its thing, then install these packages:

- Oh My ZSH (https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- Alacritty (brew install --cask alacritty)
- JankyBorders (brew tap FelixKratz/formulae && brew install borders)
- btop (brew install btop)
- cava (https://github.com/karlstav/cava)
- fastfetch (brew install fastfetch)
- skhd (brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd)
- thefuck (brew install thefuck)
- yabai (https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
- a nerd font which i forgot the name of, yes im stupid (either jetbrains or firacode, install via homebrew)

Optional:
- Raycast
- AltTab
